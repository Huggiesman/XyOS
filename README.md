# XyOS
XyOS is a 64-Bit micro-kernel written in C and Assembly designed to run on the Raspberry Pi 3B.

## Goals
- [X] Get something to boot reliably. Get familiar with AArch64 concepts.
- [X] Get access to basic peripherals on the Raspberry Pi - GPIO, UART, Timers.
- [X] Enable software and hardware interrupts
- [X] Setup virtual memory for kernel and user space
- [ ] Implement synchronization primitives - Spinlocks, Locks, CVs and Semaphores.
- [ ] Implement concurrency primitives - Interrupts, Context Switching and Threads.
- [ ] Implement user space - processes, system calls, etc.
- [ ] Build an abstraction layer for higher level peripherals - USB, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.

## Tracking Progress
An open issue is either a goal that I want to achieve or a problem that I need to fix.
As I start working on something, I'll try to explain things there via comments.
