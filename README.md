## Goals
1. Build a 64Bit Kernel for the Raspberry Pi 3B. Code bare metal, directly onto the CPU.
2. Get access to basic peripherals on the Raspberry Pi - GPIO, UART, Timers.
3. Implement synchronization primitives - Spinlocks, Locks, CVs and Semaphores.
4. Implement concurrency primitives - Interrupts, Context Switching and Threads.
5. Implement user space - processes, system calls, virtual memory.
6. Build an abstraction layer for higher level peripherals - USB, HDMI, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.

# Progress
## Issues
An open issue is either a goal that I want to achieve or a problem that I need to fix.
As I start working on the issue, I'll try to explain things there via comments.

## Wiki
I'll try to keep it upto date with my findings + my understanding of how things work on the Raspberry Pi.
